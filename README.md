# Particle Simulation

This project simulates elastic collisions between particles using Pygame. Particles bounce off walls and each other with realistic physics. The simulation uses a grid-based approach for efficient collision detection.

## Features
- Realistic elastic collisions
- Wall bouncing
- Random particle colors
- Grid-based collision optimization
- Toggle grid overlay with 'G' key

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame

## Installation
Install pygame if you don't have it:
```
pip install pygame
```

## Usage
Run the simulation:
```
python main.py
```

Press 'G' to toggle the grid overlay.

- `main.py`: Main loop and UI logic
- `particle_logic.py`: Particle physics and collision logic
